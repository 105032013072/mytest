   There no doubt that  the age of the Internet have arrived and Almost everyone is using the product of 
Internet.For the internet products,the more people use, the more data and the greater pressure to bear in terms of performance .
In order to make the product still have efficient search performance In the case of massive data,more and more Internet products combined with elasticsearch
Compared to Oracle and other databases, elasticsearch has obvious advantages in query performance.Moreover, elasticsearch can also be used for data analysis.
So,elasticsearch will be widely used because of the big data.
   Elasticsearch JDBC (hereinafter referred to as ES JDBC)is an API whitch is aimed at using elasticsearch in java development.It encapsulates the basic operation of elasticsearch
including adding、deleteing、modifing 、searching data and the creating、altering table。 its interface is presented in a form similar to JDBC
   This article first analyzes the current situation and development trend of ES JDBC in the future,then describing the significance of the development of ES JDBC,
at the same time, it also introduces the related technology;after that is the requirement analysis about ES JDBC,including feasibility analysis and functional analysis;
followed by the design of ES JDBC and the realization of each module.At last,do a summary for this work.
   ES JDBC development platform is eclipse and its JDK version is jdk1.8.
   ES JDBC simplifies the operation of elasticsearch and it reduces the workload of development,thus making the development cycle shorter.The form of JDBC also facilitates the use of developers.
